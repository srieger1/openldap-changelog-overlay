ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This work was initially developed by Neil Dunbar.
Thanks to Paul Turgyan for patching some leftover memory leaks.


DESCRIPTION

This directory contains a slapd overlay, changelog, that implements
a mechanism to store changes made to a backend as searchable entries
in a separate LDAP database.

Changes are logged as entries, with the change number forming the RDN,
in the DIT (e.g. under cn=Changelog). Entries contain the attribute
targetDN that contains the origin distinguished name of the changes.
The attribute changes contains the changes commited to the referenced
entry in an LDIF representation. For security reasons, access to the
backend storing the changelog should be carefully limited to ensure
privacy of sensitive changes by using ACLs.

Searching the changelog one can determine changes made to the DIT,
issue notifications or use the changelog entries to synchronize them
with other directories or databases. Some identity management
solutions use this legacy changelog based synchronization that was
initially defined in the draft RFC designed by Gordon Good and Ludovic
Poitou ( last known draft was draft-good-ldap-changelog-04.txt )


INSTALLATION

First make sure that OpenLDAP was built from the parental source
directory. Make sure you enabled modules (configure --enable-modules).
The Makefile provided for this module uses some dependencies of the
initial OpenLDAP build. After compiling the OpenLDAP source and 
installing it, simply run

    make

in this directory. If you want to install the module you can run

    make install

after checking and eventually changing the installation directory
of OpenLDAP in the Makefile (the module will be placed in
INSTALLPATH).

Alternatively a patch (changelog-<openldap-version>.patch) is
provided to integrate the changelog module as a regular overlay
to slapd. The patch was build against the version referenced in
the file name but with some luck it will succeed also with future
versions. You can apply the patch in the root of the OpenLDAP
source directory using

    patch -p1 <./contrib/slapd-modules/changelog/changelog-*.patch

After patching the source you need to copy the changelog.c from
this directory to servers/slapd/overlays in the OpenLDAP source.
Having this done you should be able to compile the changelog overlay
e.g. by using the following on the OpenLDAP source

    configure --enable-changelog
    make depend
    make
    make install


CONFIGURATION

To use the module in OpenLDAP you have to modify your slapd.conf.
If you chose to build it as a module rather than patching the
source and compiling it as a static overlay you need to:

    modulepath      /usr/local/libexec/openldap
    moduleload      changelog.la

next you need to configure a separate backend that stores the
changes. You may want to use a different location or different
parameters to increase performance when you have a lot of
frequent changes being made to the DIT.

    database        bdb
    suffix          "cn=Changelog"
    rootdn          "cn=Changelog"
    rootpw          secret
    directory       /usr/local/var/openldap/openldap-changelog

to store the changes being made to your regular backend
databse you need to reference the overlay in its configuration:

    database        bdb

    overlay         changelog
    changelog_db    "cn=Changelog"
    changelog_convert_replace
    changelog_retention_time	1209600
    changelog_prune_time	300
    changelog_dump_entry_filter ldap://localhost/cn=test(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

    suffix          "dc=my-domain,dc=com"
    rootdn          "cn=Manager,dc=my-domain,dc=com"
    rootpw          secret   
    directory       /usr/local/var/openldap/openldap-data

The changelog_db parameter references the backend used to store
the changes (as mentioned above). The changelog_db is the only
mandatory parameter to use the changelog overlay.
changelog_convert_replace can be used to split ldapmodify
operations using replace into two separate add and delete
operations. changelog_retention_time defines how long changes
are kept in the changelog backend before being pruned in
seconds. changelog_prune_time defines how often the backend
is scaned for old entries by the changelog overlay (again in
seconds). The changelog_dump_entry_filter can be used to
store the entire old entry (as it was before the change) in
the oldEntry attribute in the changelog. Only entries that
fullfill the given filter statement will get dumped.
